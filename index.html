            <h2>general guidelines</h2>
            
            <p>Writing clean and readable code is not hard, but it is 
            very important towards the maintainability of your program. <br />
            Readability is achieved by through experience and 
            practiced intuition, but can be guided by key principles 
            including:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Good variable names.</strong> Every variable should have an 
                identifier (name) that directly reflects what it represents. A variable that is <br />
                describing the number of ducks in a pond might be called ducks or 
                count but it shouldn't be called something like pancakes. <br />
                Never name your variables as single letters (except for counters in for loops) 
                or anything too abstract.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Function naming and responsibility.</strong> Make sure your functions a
                lso are named well represent what the function does. Every <br />
                function should also have a single responsibility, something you could describe 
                in a sentence or two. (This is called the SINGLE <br />
                RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE).</li>
                
                <li><strong>Proper formatting.</strong> Always maintain correct and consistent 
                indentation, spacing, and location of curly braces, if required by the <br />
                language. One of the most helpful motivations for clean and consistent formatting 
                is to consider the perspective of the person <br />
                trying to understand your code, making sure one could painlessly read and 
                interpret your code's purpose through a consistent <br />
                organization and hierarchal structure.</li>
                
                <li><strong> Clear documentation.</strong> You should provide clear 
                documentation in all of your web development work, describing functions, key <br />
                variables or constants, and any particularly complex sections of code. 
                At the same time, your documentation should be
                client- <br />
                focused, avoiding implementation details about how your programs are 
                implemented (this latter point is especially
                relevant <br /> 
                when working with function-based programming languages like JavaScript and PHP).</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>commenting for cse 154</h2>

        <h3>commenting your html and css code</h3>
        
        <p>The comment tag is used to insert comments in your HTML source code. 
        Text written inside of comment tags are not
        displayed by <br />
        the browser. The comment tag is <code>&lt;!-- your comment here --></code>. </p>
        
        <p>The comments in CSS are wrapped between <code>/* your comment here */</code>.  
        Comments in HTML and CSS can also span multiple <br />
        lines.</p>

        <h3>commenting your javascript code</h3>
            
        <p>There are two different ways to comment in JavaScript code:</p>
            
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Single-line comments: </strong>Single-line comments: 
            Including <code>//</code> in front of the single line of code
            that you want to comment out.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Multi-line comments: </strong>This method of commenting 
            is exactly the same as commenting CSS files. You insert multiple
            lines of <br />
            code between the following: <code>/* your comment here */</code></li>
        </ol>
            
        <p>JavaScript is used <strong>boundlessly</strong> to develop huge applications 
        and Application Program Interfaces (APIs). Because of this, good <br />
        documentation of the application is necessary. 
        To document our API's and applications, we use a documentation generator called <br />
        <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a>.</p>
        <p>Some of the important <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a> rules:</p>
            
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Each comment must start with a <code>/**</code> sequence in order to be recognized by the 
            <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a> parser. Comments beginning <br />
            with <code>/*</code>, <code>/***</code>, or more than 3 stars will be ignored. 
            This is to suppress parsing of comment blocks.</li>
            <li>Use <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a> tags to provide more information about the code:
                <ul>
                    
                <li>If the function to be commented is a constructor, then
                add a <code>@constructor</code> tag to it.</li>
                    
                <li>Use <code>@param {data type}</code> to tag the parameters.
                    Each parameter gets a different tag and on a different line.</li>
                    
                <li>Use <code>@return {data type}</code> to tag the return type for the function.
                    Explain what it represents in a sentence.</li>
                </ul>
                
            </li>
            <li>The comment should also include a single sentence description 
                for the function as well as for each parameter.</li>
            
        </ol>

        <p>Though you are not required to for this class, you can generate the  
        documentation webpage, run the following command in a terminal <br />
        window: <code>jsdoc relative-path/book.js </code><br />
        This command will create a directory name <code>out/</code> in the current 
        working directory. Within that directory, you will find the <br />
        generated HTML pages.

        <h3>commenting your php code</h3>
            
        <p>Commenting in PHP is exactly the same as commenting in JavaScript by 
        using <code>//</code> for single-line comments and <code>/* ... */</code> for multi- <br />
        line comments.</p>
            
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: </strong>Make sure to add the comment 
        after the opening PHP tag as shown below.</p>

        <h3>commenting your sql</h3>
            
        <p>We're going to cut you some slack here... we don't require you 
        to comment your SQL code (It is pretty much self-explanatory, isn't <br />
        it?).</p>
            
        <p>Now that you have read this document, make this quote your mantra:</p>
            
        <blockquote>"Writing well-documented code is not only important for  
        communicating with others in your team. <br /> 
        It's also for communicating with yourself in the future." <br />
        - Dr. Lauren Bricker</blockquote>
